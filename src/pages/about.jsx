        <p>
          I'm 22 years old and I'm currently a 3rd year student of IT at
          University of Rzesz√≥w. I started to learn the widely understood
          "frontend" about 3 years ago. I enjoy getting to know and learning new
          technologies. Besides programming, sport is also a big part of my
          life. Several years playing football, then gym, jujitsu and boxing,
          and finally swimming and chess (I know, a strange combination). It has
          taught me to be persistent in achieving my goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I think that I am ready to start my adventure with work /
          internship as a frontend-developer and if you think so too and want to
          give me a chance please contact me via email /dvdk98@gmail.com/.
